introduction of Dream, RAT with few ref...

quick motivation and main hypothesis:
in social HRI, combining human supervision and machine learning - human level performance can be achieved whilst relying less on the human overtime, resulting on a lower workload on the human side

\section{Research Scope}

present limitation of the research: presence of a human constantly available, discrete actions, HRHI

definition of metrics tlx - research focus - justification of limits - potential direction - opening?

\section{Research Questions}

consequences from the hypothesis

How to design an interaction setup allowing supervised autonomy and ML

Which algorithm can be used to allow online learning of action policy for social HRI

how to be able to test the setup - not possible to rely on HRHI as it is composed of 2 HRI
